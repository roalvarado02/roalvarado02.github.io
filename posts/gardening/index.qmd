title: "Volunteering at the Methodist Church Community Garden in Isla Vista - A Reflection" 
description: "This reflective piece explores my quarter-long experience volunteering at the Methodist Church Community Garden in Isla Vista. It was a space originally built to combat food insecurity and foster community connection. I entered with expectations of collaboration, learning, and social engagement, but the reality revealed gaps in visibility, participation, and impact. Through firsthand encounters, I assessed the challenges of gardening alone, the importance of community engagement, and the deeper systemic issues that prevent the success of food justice projects. Ultimately, this reflection explores the difference between intention and impact and what it takes to make a community garden work. "
