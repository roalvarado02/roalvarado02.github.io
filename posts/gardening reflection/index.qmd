title: "Volunteering at the Methodist Church Community Garden in Isla Vista - A Reflection" 
description: "This reflection shares my experience volunteering at a community garden meant to fight food insecurity in Isla Vista. What I found instead was a quiet, overlooked space with little community engagement. I explore the gap between intention and impact, and what it really takes to make community gardens work."
