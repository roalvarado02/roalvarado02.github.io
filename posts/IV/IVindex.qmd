title: "Case Study: IV Theater" 
description: "In this case study, I evaluated the sustainability of UCSB's Isla Vista Theater. I was able to highlight strengths in walkability, waste management, and light pollution reduction while also identifying improvement areas such as outdated plumbing, lack of renewable energy, and inefficient lighting systems. Through technical assessments and targeted recommendations, I was able to offer practical strategies to enhance the building’s environmental performance and align it more closely with UCSB’s sustainability goals."
